		<h1 style="text-align:center;color:red; font-weight:bold"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenburg Overview</a> </h1>
			<p style="color:#F1E9D2"> Project Gutenburg was begun by Michael Hart in 1971 in order to produce replicable electronic texts to be shared and used by a large audience. It aims to provide open-access literature at 99.9% accuracy to a broad audience with access to diverse browsing technologies. </p>
			<p style="color:#F1E9D2"> The etexts are transcribed in the simplest text form in order that they can be read and replicated easily. </p>
		<h2 style="color:red; font-weight:bold"> History of Project Gutenburg </h2>
			<p style="color:#F1E9D2"> With $100,000,000 in computer time through his operator account, Hart decided that the greatest value of computers would be the storage, retrieval, searching of information. He created an e-text of the Declaration of Independence, and argued that this equalled the vast amount of money in computer time because the e-text accounted for 100,000,000 accessible copies of the Declaration of Independence. From there, the project grew to include fifty years worth of open access literature in replicable, accessible e-text format.</p>
		<h2 style="color:red; font-weight:bold"> Database Content </h2>
			<p style="color:#F1E9D2"> The project provides a variety of etext formats for books. Each item includes a list of descriptive elements, including:
				
				<ul style="font-style:italic; color:#F1E9D2">
					<li> Biographical information </li>
					<li> Copyright status </li>
					<li> Release date </li>
					<li> Reading level </li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p style="color:#F1E9D2">Some data points, such as author, are linked to more texts by the same author, or to related books. </p>
			<p style="color:#F1E9D2"> Users are able to search books with advanced search tools, or the database can generate a list of books at random from which the user can choose. The website also arranges books by:
				<ul style="font-style:italic; color:#F1E9D2"> 
					<li> Alphabet </li>
					<li> Popularity </li>
					<li> Language </li> 
					<li> Date of publication within the Gutenburg Project </li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p style="color:#F1E9D2"> The collection has over 75,000 titles and it continually grows as materials become open-source. </p>
			
		<h2 style="color:red; font-weight:bold"> Unique Features </h2>
			<p style="color:#F1E9D2"> Project Gutenburg's versatile texts can be read online, downloaded and printed, or transfered to a handheld device to be read through applications such as Kindle. </p>
			
		<h2 style="color:red; font-weight:bold"> Collection Users </h2>
			<p style="color:#F1E9D2"> Project Gutenburg is an open source for anyone with access to the internet. It can be used by researchers or anyone interested in reading literature in the public domain. </p>
			
		<h2 style="color:red; font-weight:bold"> Drawbacks to Collection </h2>
			<p style="color:#F1E9D2"> Project Gutenburg's collection is limited by the following factors:
				<ul style="font-style:italic; color:#F1E9D2">
					<li> Not authorized to publish materials protected by copyright </li>
					<li> Publishes only one edition of an open source text</li>
					<li> Does not necessarily provide the most authoritative version of a text </li>
				</ul> 
				</p>
				<p style="color:#F1E9D2">While the collection cannot provide open-source e-texts for all literary works, it provides easy access to a broad range of literature for academic or leisurely consumption.</p>
				
			<h2 style="color:red; font-weight:bold"> Conclusion </h2>
